Resposta:
 To identify the **independent variables** in a causal graph — that is, variables that are **not causally influenced by any other variables** in the system — we need to think step by step based on the **causal structure** of the data and the **context of GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor)**.

We are given a list of variables, and our goal is to determine which of them are **independent** (i.e., **not caused by any other variable** in the system). This means they are **exogenous** — their values are not determined by the others, even if they are correlated.

---

### Step 1: Understand what "independent" means in a causal graph

In a causal graph:
- **Independent variables (exogenous variables)** are not influenced by any other variables.
- They are the **starting points** of the causal chain.
- They may influence other variables (e.g., tumor grade affects survival), but they are not caused by any other variable.

We are not looking for variables that are statistically independent (i.e., uncorrelated), but rather **causally independent** — not influenced by any other variable.

---

### Step 2: Identify variables that are **not influenced by others**

Let’s go through the variables and assess whether they could be **caused by** any other variable in the dataset.

#### 1. `age_at_diagnosis`
- Likely influenced by patient demographics and biological factors.
- But age is a **baseline characteristic** — it's not caused by the tumor or treatment.
- However, **age may be correlated with survival**, but not caused by it.
- ✅ **Likely independent** (exogenous)

#### 2. `gender`
- A biological attribute — fixed at diagnosis.
- Not caused by tumor, treatment, or other clinical features.
- ✅ **Independent**

#### 3. `race` / `ethnicity`
- Socio-demographic variables.
- Not caused by tumor biology or treatment.
- May influence access to care, but not caused by any other variable.
- ✅ **Independent**

#### 4. `stage_at_diagnosis`, `derived_eod_stage_group`, `tumor_size`, `tumor_grade`
- These are **clinical outcomes** of the tumor.
- `tumor_grade` is a histopathological feature — determined by pathology, not caused by treatment.
- `stage_at_diagnosis` is derived from tumor size, location, and spread — **so it is caused by tumor_size, metastatic_site, etc.**
- `tumor_size` and `tumor_grade` are **not caused by treatment or diagnosis** — but they are **influenced by tumor biology**.
- However, **tumor_size** may be influenced by time (e.g., `tumor_size_over_time`), but at diagnosis, it's a baseline.
- But note: `tumor_size` is a **cause** of stage and survival — not caused by other variables.
- So: `tumor_size`, `tumor_grade` → **independent** (they are observed at diagnosis)
- ❌ But `stage_at_diagnosis` is **caused by** tumor_size, primary_site, metastatic_site → **not independent**
- ❌ `derived_eod_stage_group` is derived from EOD parameters → **not independent**

#### 5. `primary_site`
- Where the tumor originated (e.g., stomach, small intestine).
- This is a **biological origin**, not caused by treatment or other variables.
- It may influence tumor behavior, but not caused by anything else.
- ✅ **Independent**

#### 6. `metastatic_site`
- Where cancer spread.
- This is a **result** of tumor progression — not caused by diagnosis or treatment directly.
- But it **can be caused by tumor biology** (e.g., tumor grade, stage).
- So: **not independent** — it's a downstream outcome of tumor spread.
- ❌ **Dependent**

#### 7. `os_months`, `os_status`, `vital_status`, `cause_specific_death`, `other_cause_of_death`
- These are **outcomes** of the disease course.
- Survival is **caused by** tumor grade, size, stage, treatment, etc.
- ❌ All are **dependent variables** — they are consequences.

#### 8. `surgery_of_primary_site`, `scope_regional_lymph_surgery`, `surgery_of_other_site`
- These are **treatment decisions**.
- These are **influenced by** diagnosis, stage, patient condition, access to care, etc.
- They may **affect survival**, but are **not independent** — they are **caused by** clinical judgment based on diagnosis.
- ❌ Not independent

#### 9. `radiation_sequence_with_surgery`, `radiation_type`, `systemic_sequence_with_surgery`
- These are **treatment sequences**.
- These are **determined by clinical decisions** based on diagnosis, stage, and patient factors.
- So they are **not independent**.
- ❌ Not independent

#### 10. `diagnosis_to_treatment_days`
- Time between diagnosis and treatment.
- This is **caused by** healthcare access, patient decisions, system delays — not caused by tumor biology.
- But it's **influenced by** other variables (e.g., year_of_diagnosis, region, access to care).
- So it's **not a true exogenous variable** — it's a proxy for care system factors.
- ❌ Not independent

#### 11. `year_of_diagnosis`
- This is a **time variable**.
- It may influence treatment patterns (e.g., new therapies in later years).
- But it is **not caused by any other variable** — it's a baseline.
- ✅ **Independent** (exogenous)

#### 12. `derived_eod_t`, `derived_eod_n`
- These are derived from tumor size and lymph node involvement.
- So they are **caused by** `tumor_size`, `metastatic_site`, etc.
- ❌ Not independent

#### 13. `tumor_size_over_time`
- This is a **dynamic progression** — clearly **dependent** on tumor biology and treatment.
- ❌ Not independent

#### 14. `survival_months_flag`
- A flag indicating reliability of survival data.
- This is a **data quality variable**, not a biological outcome.
- It may be influenced by missingness or data entry — not a causal variable.
- But it's not a cause or effect of disease — more of a **measurement artifact**.
- ✅ Possibly independent (as it's a data flag)

But: Is it **causally independent**? Probably yes — it's not caused by any other variable in the system.

---

### Step 3: Final list of variables that are **not caused by any other variable**

We now compile only those variables that are **not influenced** by any other variable in the system.

These are **exogenous** variables.

✅ **Independent variables (exogenous)**:

1. `age_at_diagnosis`
2. `gender`
3. `race`
4. `ethnicity`
5. `primary_site`
6. `year_of_diagnosis`
7. `survival_months_flag`

> Why not `tumor_grade` or `tumor_size`?
> Because tumor grade and size are **biological features** of the tumor that are **not caused** by treatment or diagnosis — they are **inherent**.
> However, in the context of a **causal graph**, tumor grade and size are **measured at diagnosis** and **not caused by other variables** — they are **independent**.

But wait: in some models, tumor grade is **influenced by** the tumor's biology, which is not directly observed. But in the data, they are **observed at diagnosis**, and not derived from other variables.

So are they independent?

Yes — **tumor_grade** and **tumor_size** are **not caused by any other variable in the dataset**.

Let’s re-evaluate:

- `tumor_size`: Is it caused by anything? Only by tumor growth — not by diagnosis or treatment. At diagnosis, it's a baseline.
- `tumor_grade`: Determined by pathology — not caused by other variables.
- So both are **exogenous**.

Similarly, `primary_site` is exogenous.

But note: `stage_at_diagnosis` is **not** independent — it is derived from tumor_size, primary_site, metastasis.

So:

✅ Final list of **independent (exogenous)** variables:

- `age_at_diagnosis`
- `gender`
- `race`
- `ethnicity`
- `primary_site`
- `tumor_size`
- `tumor_grade`
- `year_of_diagnosis`
- `survival_months_flag`

Wait — is `tumor_size` **influenced** by treatment? Not at diagnosis. At diagnosis, it's a snapshot.

So yes — it is a **baseline characteristic**.

Similarly, `tumor_grade` is a histological feature — not caused by treatment or diagnosis.

Thus, they are **independent**.

---

### Final Check: Are any of these caused by others?

- `age_at_diagnosis` → no
- `gender` → no
- `race`, `ethnicity` → no
- `primary_site` → no
- `tumor_size` → not caused by treatment, diagnosis, or stage — it's a direct measurement
- `tumor_grade` → not caused by anything else — determined by pathology
- `year_of_diagnosis` → not caused by anything
- `survival_months_flag` → data flag — not caused by any other variable

All are **exogenous**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer (variables that are independent):

```
age_at_diagnosis, gender, race, ethnicity, primary_site, tumor_size, tumor_grade, year_of_diagnosis, survival_months_flag
```

> Note: We excluded `stage_at_diagnosis`, `metastatic_site`, `os_months`, etc., because they are **caused by** tumor characteristics or treatment.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
```
age_at_diagnosis, gender, race, ethnicity, primary_site, tumor_size, tumor_grade, year_of_diagnosis, survival_months_flag
```
